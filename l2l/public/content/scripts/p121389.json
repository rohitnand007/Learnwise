A horizontal-axis wind-turbine rotor usually consists of two or three blades attached to a horizontal shaft on top of a support tower.\",\"Larger wind turbines tend to rotate more slowly and need a gearbox to step up the speed to generate electricity. On horizontal-axis wind turbines, the generator is located at the top of the tower in line with the rotating horizontal shaft. The shaft rotates the generator thus producing electricity.\",\"The wind passes over both surfaces of the airfoil shaped blade but passes more rapidly over the longer (upper) side of the airfoil, thus creating a lower-pressure area above the airfoil.\",\"The pressure differential between top and bottom surfaces results in aerodynamic lift. This lift force causes rotation about the hub.\",\"The efficiency of windmills and the energy extracted from wind depends upon the shape and size of the blades, the area swept by the blades and the velocity of the wind.\"","summary_text":"\"Windmills are structures used to harness the energy of wind.\",\"A windmill converts the kinetic energy of wind into the rotational motion of the blade.\",\"The rotational motion of the wind turbine blades is converted to electricity using an electrical generator.\"","created_at":"2017-05-25T17:49:00.000Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T09:11:42.000Z","url":"http://content.fortunapix.com/scripts/89.json"}
